# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Every bug below must be fixed at its root cause. "Detect the
symptom and suppress the diagnostic" is not an acceptable fix.
If the type resolution pipeline produces wrong data, fix the
pipeline so it produces correct data. Downstream consumers
(diagnostics, hover, completion, definition) should never need
to second-guess upstream output.



## B3 — Array access on bare `array` returns empty instead of `mixed`

**Root cause:** The type resolution pipeline does not handle array
element access on the bare `array` type. When a parameter is typed
as `array` (no generic annotation), accessing an element with
`$params['key']` resolves to an empty/untyped result instead of
`mixed`.

**Where to fix:** The array access resolution code (wherever
`$var['key']` is resolved to a type) must recognise bare `array`
and `mixed` as "unknown element type" and return `mixed`. This is
a fix in the variable/expression type resolution pipeline, not in
any diagnostic.

**Downstream effect:** Once the pipeline returns `mixed` for array
access on bare `array`, the following resolve correctly without any
additional changes:

- `$x = $params['key'] ?? null` resolves `$x` to `mixed|null`
  instead of just `null`.
- `type_error.argument` no longer flags `null` passed to `string`
  because the resolved type is `mixed|null`, which is compatible
  with anything.

Reproducer:

```php
function foo(array $params = []): void {
    $authToken = $params['authToken'] ?? null;
    if (!$authToken || !is_string($authToken)) {
        throw new \Exception('missing');
    }
    // $authToken is string here, but diagnostic sees null
    bar($authToken);
}
function bar(string $s): void {}
```

## B9 — `parent::__construct()` does not substitute `@extends` generics into inherited parameter types

**Root cause:** When a child class has `@extends Parent<Concrete>`
and calls `parent::__construct($arg)`, the diagnostic pipeline
resolves the callable target to the parent's constructor without
applying the child's `@extends` generic substitution. The parent
constructor's `@param ?T $item` retains the raw template name `T`
instead of being substituted with the concrete type from the
child's `@extends` annotation.

**Where to fix:** The callable target resolution for
`parent::__construct(...)` (in `resolve_constructor_callable` or
the `NewExpr` arm of `resolve_callable_target_with_args`) must
detect that the call originates from a child class, look up the
child's `extends_generics`, and apply template substitution to the
parent class before returning its constructor's parameter types.

Reproducer:

```php
/**
 * @template T of object
 */
class ItemResult {
    /** @param ?T $item */
    public function __construct(private readonly ?object $item) {}
}

/**
 * @extends ItemResult<BonusCashItem>
 */
final class BonusCashItemResult extends ItemResult {
    public function __construct(?BonusCashItem $credited) {
        parent::__construct($credited);
        // false positive: "expects ?T, got BonusCashItem"
    }
}

class BonusCashItem {}
```

## B10 — Foreach iteration on `@extends` subclass yields raw template param instead of concrete type

**Root cause:** When iterating over a variable whose type is a
subclass that extends a generic collection (e.g.
`IntCollection extends Collection<int, int>`), the foreach
element-type extraction does not look through the child's
`@extends` generics to substitute the parent's template params.
The iteration variable gets typed as raw `TValue` instead of `int`.

**Where to fix:** The foreach element-type resolution (in
`foreach_resolution.rs` or wherever the iterable element type is
extracted) must resolve `@extends` generics from the child class
before extracting the element type. When the variable's class is
`IntCollection` and it extends `Collection<int, int>`, the
iteration element type must be `int`, not `TValue`.

**Replicate on shared project:**

```
phpantom_lsp analyze --project-root shared --no-colour 2>/dev/null -- src/database/Model/Products/Filters/ProductFilterTermCollection.php
```

Reproducer:

```php
/**
 * @template TKey of array-key
 * @template TValue
 */
class Collection implements \ArrayAccess {
    /** @return TValue */
    public function offsetGet(mixed $offset): mixed {}
    public function offsetExists(mixed $offset): bool {}
    public function offsetSet(mixed $offset, mixed $value): void {}
    public function offsetUnset(mixed $offset): void {}
}

/** @extends Collection<int, int> */
final class IntCollection extends Collection {}

function test(): void {
    $ids = new IntCollection();
    foreach ($ids as $id) {
        // $id should be int, but resolves to TValue
        array_key_exists($id, [1 => 'a']);
        // false positive: "expects int|string, got TValue"
    }
}
```

## B11 — Static method-level `@template` not substituted when argument is a closure literal

**Root cause:** When a static method declares a method-level
`@template T of SomeType` and `@param T $param`, and the call-site
argument is a closure literal (e.g. `fn(array $q): bool => ...`),
`build_method_template_subs` either fails to resolve the argument
text to a type or the binding mode does not fire. The raw template
name (e.g. `TClosure`) leaks into the parameter type.

**Where to fix:** `build_method_template_subs` in
`call_resolution.rs` and/or `resolve_arg_text_to_type`. When the
argument text starts with `fn(` or `function(`, it should be
recognised as a `Closure` type (or more specifically
`Closure(params): ReturnType`) and used to bind the template param.

Reproducer:

```php
class Mockery {
    /**
     * @template TClosure of \Closure
     * @param TClosure $closure
     * @return ClosureMatcher
     */
    public static function on($closure) {
        return new ClosureMatcher($closure);
    }
}

class ClosureMatcher {}

function test(): void {
    Mockery::on(fn(array $query): bool => true);
    // false positive: "expects TClosure, got Closure"
}
```

## B8 — Class-level template parameters lost through chained method calls

**Root cause:** When a method returns a generic class (e.g.
`Collection<Product>`) and the next method in the chain accesses a
member of that class, the generic type arguments are discarded
during the chain resolution. Specifically,
`resolve_call_return_types_expr` converts intermediate
`ResolvedType` values (which carry generic args in their
`type_string` field) to `Vec<Arc<ClassInfo>>` via
`into_arced_classes`. This conversion discards the `type_string`,
so by the time the next method's return type needs to be
template-substituted, the generic arguments are gone.

**Where to fix:** The `MethodCall` arm of
`resolve_call_return_types_expr` must thread `ResolvedType` (with
its `type_string`) through to the method return-type resolution
step instead of flattening to bare `ClassInfo` first. The generic
arguments from the intermediate return type must survive into
`build_generic_subs` so that template substitution works at every
level of the chain, not just the first.

The first call in a chain already works (B6 fix). The fix here is
to apply the same pattern to subsequent calls in the chain.

Reproducer:

```php
/**
 * @template TItem
 */
class Collection {
    /** @param TItem $item */
    public function add($item): void {}

    /** @return self<TItem> */
    public function filter(): self { return $this; }
}

class Product {}

class Store {
    /** @return Collection<Product> */
    public function products(): Collection { return new Collection(); }
}

function test(): void {
    $store = new Store();
    $product = new Product();
    // First level works: $store->products()->add($product)
    // Second level fails: $store->products()->filter()->add($product)
    // false positive: "expects TItem, got Product"
    $store->products()->filter()->add($product);
}
```

## B12 — Hover cross-file property docblock cache invalidation fails after edits

**Root cause:** When a class is loaded from a cross-file source
(PSR-4 or classmap) and its docblock is later edited, hover
continues to show the stale docblock content instead of the updated
version. The parsed `ClassInfo` cached in `ast_map` and/or
`fqn_index` is not invalidated when the dependency file changes.

**Tests:** Six integration tests covering this bug were removed
because they were committed in a failing state. The fix must
include new passing tests for at least these scenarios:

- PSR-4 lazy-loaded class, then docblock edited (`did_change`)
- Dependent child class inheriting a changed `@property`
- `@var`-annotated variable accessing a cross-file property
- Method-chain access (`$this->getJob()->class_name`)
- Cache warm → edit → hover (eviction path)
- Child class with Model parent (Laravel `@property` interaction)

**Where to fix:** The cache layer that stores cross-file
`ClassInfo` results must be invalidated (or re-parsed) when
`didChange` or `didSave` fires for the dependency file. The
`resolved_class_cache` and/or `fqn_index` entries for the changed
URI must be evicted so that the next hover request re-parses the
file and picks up the new docblock content.

## B19 — Namespace-qualified scalar types hit class resolution

**Root cause:** When `find_or_load_class` is called with names like
`Tests\Feature\BusinessCentral\int`, `Tests\Support\array`, or
`Tests\Unit\Customers\bool`, these are scalar type hints that were
namespace-qualified by the name resolver (or the variable resolution
pipeline) instead of being recognised as built-in types. The class
resolution pipeline then walks through `fqn_index`, `class_index`,
`classmap`, and PSR-4 for each one before giving up and caching
a negative result. In the analyse pipeline this adds thousands of
wasted lookups per run.

**Where to fix:** Two complementary fixes:

1. The callers that produce these names (variable resolution,
   type-hint resolution) should recognise bare scalar keywords
   (`int`, `float`, `string`, `bool`, `array`, `object`, `mixed`,
   `void`, `null`, `never`, `true`, `false`, `callable`, `iterable`,
   `self`, `static`, `parent`) and never pass them to class
   resolution — even when they carry a namespace prefix. A type
   whose last segment is a scalar keyword is never a class.

2. As a safety net, `find_or_load_class_inner` could short-circuit
   on names whose last segment is a known scalar keyword, avoiding
   the multi-phase search entirely.
