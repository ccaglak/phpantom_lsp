# PHPantom — Bug Fixes

Known bugs and incorrect behaviour. These are distinct from feature
requests — they represent cases where existing functionality produces
wrong results. Bugs should generally be fixed before new features at
the same impact tier.

Items are ordered by **impact** (descending), then **effort** (ascending)
within the same impact tier.

## B11.  Diagnostic deduplication drops distinct diagnostics on the same range

- **Impact:** Medium · **Effort:** Low
- The diagnostic publisher deduplicates by LSP range. When two
  different diagnostics land on the same span (e.g. an unknown-member
  warning and a deprecation notice on the same call), the second one
  is silently dropped.

---

## B13. Argument count diagnostic flags too many arguments by default

- **Impact:** High · **Effort:** Low
- PHP silently ignores extra arguments, so flagging them as errors
  produces false positives in codebases that rely on this behaviour.
  The check should be off by default and gated behind an opt-in
  config key.

## B14. Redundant file re-parsing in unknown-member diagnostics

- **Impact:** Medium · **Effort:** Medium-High

The subject deduplication cache (per-pass `SubjectCache`) eliminated
the worst case where identical subjects were resolved hundreds of
times. However, each *unique* subject that goes through variable
resolution still calls `with_parsed_program`, which re-parses the
entire file from scratch. For unresolved subjects, the secondary
helpers (`resolve_scalar_subject_type`,
`resolve_unresolvable_class_subject`) add further re-parses. A
single unique untyped variable subject can trigger up to 6 full
re-parses of the file.

In files with many distinct variable subjects (e.g. different
`$var1->`, `$var2->`, `$var3->` accesses), the parsing cost still
adds up even with the subject cache.

### Fix — parse caching within a diagnostic pass

The file content is immutable during a single diagnostic pass.
Caching the parsed `Program` AST once and threading it through the
resolution calls would eliminate all redundant parsing, reducing
even the per-unique-subject cost. This is a larger refactor because
`with_parsed_program` is used across many modules and the `Program`
type borrows from a `bumpalo::Bump` arena that must stay alive.

## B15. Array element from method return chain not resolved in diagnostics

- **Impact:** Low · **Effort:** Low

When a method returns an array type (e.g. `@return Item[]`) and the
caller indexes into it inline (`$c->items()[0]->getLabel()`), the
diagnostics pipeline fails to resolve the element type. The subject
`$c->items()[0]` is a `CallExpr` followed by array access, but
`resolve_target_classes` does not thread the array element type
through the method-return → index → member chain.

The same pattern works when the array is assigned to a variable
first (`$items = $c->items(); $items[0]->getLabel()`), because the
variable resolution path handles `@var` annotations on the
intermediate variable. Only the inline form is broken.

### Reproduction

```php
class Item {
    public function getLabel(): string { return ''; }
}
class Collection {
    /** @return Item[] */
    public function items(): array { return []; }
}
function test(): void {
    $c = new Collection();
    // ✗ subject type not resolved — false "cannot verify" warning
    $c->items()[0]->getLabel()->nonexistent();
}
```

### Fix

When `resolve_target_classes_expr` encounters an `ArrayAccess` whose
base is a `CallExpr`, resolve the call's return type, strip one
array dimension, and use the element type as the resolved class.
This is the same logic that already exists for `ArrayAccess` on
bare variables — it just needs to be extended to call-expression
bases.
